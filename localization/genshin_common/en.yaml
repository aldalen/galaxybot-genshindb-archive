# This file contains all strings used by Galaxy.Bot. This forms a hierarchical structure for easy lookup by the bot.
# To localize in another language, simply ensure that the same "hierarchy" exists in the other language file and fill
#    the strings. If a string does not exist for a specific language, the English one is used
# In some strings you will see a "{}". This is used by the bot to insert generated text into the line.
