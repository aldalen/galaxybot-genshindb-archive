# Notes will look in the localization file. It will check the following areas, in order, to find the matching localization key.
#  1. The matching `set_rating` list for this character. For example, a key below with `max_skill` for albedo-subdps would match `albedo-subdps.set_rating.max_skill`.  (or, look for the key `max_skill` under `set_rating` under `albedo-subdps`)
#  2. `common_set_rating`  For example, a key below with `max_skill` would match `common_set_rating.max_skill` (or, look for the key `max_skill` under `common_set_rating`)
# Notes can also be a list of keys, which will combine into one.  Each list item will follow the same lookup order above.
