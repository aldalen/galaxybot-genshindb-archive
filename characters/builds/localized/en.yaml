    - Each mirror has 4 sec lifetime which means you want to spawn a new mirror every 4 seconds to maintain max DPS with three mirrors
    
    - 4 sec after summoning mirrors via Burst use either CA or Skill to regenerate a mirror
    
    - 8 sec after summoning mirrors use the other one
    
    - Between these keep using NA strings to maximize Spread procs  
    
    - 12 sec after summoning mirrors feel free to either continue attacking with fewer mirrors until they all run out or swap out early and prepare the next rotation
    
    - For a more Quickswap-style rotation do Skill, CA, Burst, wait 2 sec, NA/CA strings for 4 sec and swap out. It's way less avg DPS than sustained but also takes less field time"

    - Xingqiu can be replaced with Yelan or an on-field Hydro DPS such as Tartaglia (International), Ayato or Neuvillette. Usually the 4th unit then ends up being an Anemo to swirl both Pyro and Hydro

  playstyle: "- Xianyun is an ATK-scaling Anemo healer and Plunge DMG enabler and buffer
  
    - Use Skill to jump high in the air, follow it by plunge or more Skills to deal increased DMG with the ensuing plunge

    - Once the Plunge hits enemies it'll grant your party Plunge DMG CR bonus. The more enemies you hit, the higher the bonus

    - Your party will have 8 stacks of Plunge DMG instances per rotation
    
    - Active character deals additive Plunge DMG during active Burst based on Xiayun's ATK, therefore ATK > HB circlet for extra DMG potential
    
    - ER requirements vary from 130% (triple Anemo) all the way to 230% (rainbow teams). Use ER sands if needed to reach energy requirements. Build CR for Fav Codex if using it
    
    - VV remains the best artifact set; other sets are to be used mainly where VV shred is not needed (Anemo/Geo/Dendro)"
  teammates: "- Xianyun is best utilized supporting other DPS units who'd make good use of plunge attacks

    - Mona/Yelan: Vape enabler with Skill while grouping enemies with taunt, Burst provides a massive DMG bonus as well as does DMG itself. Note that neither may not apply enough Hydro for consistent Vaporize without a second Hydro character.

    - Venti/Kazuha/Sucrose: Grouping + resistance shred with VV, Sucrose provides EM, Kazuha provides Elem DMG bonus

    - Bennett: Pyro Sub DPS/Support. Essential for this team
